# RFP - Bearcat Study Buddy

## Statement of Purpose :
We would like to build a tool which is student friendly web application where it would help students to have an exact overview of the class tasks, it encourages students to complete all the tasks on time by providing to-do lists as well as memo functionality and it would help in displaying in due date for exams, assignments etc. This application will provide the student calendar visualized for all the tasks for the users. This app even provides us with a flexibility to select his own choice of themes.

## Vision

* We would like to create the progressive web application in which upon by clicking the application we will be directed into the screen where it will get displayed two options sign up and sign in.

* If we have new students, they need to create the profile newly by clicking sign up. Existing students can login using sign in option.<br>   

* In login of the existing  student users, we will include the two-factor authentication with User id and mobile number. For mobile number authentication we will receive verification code to our mobile after entering the phone number.<br>  

* Upon existing student login, it will have a pop-up to ask to which course he is getting registered to and his schedule.

* In student login in it will display grid view of courses the student registered and on the left side of the page it will display notifications of all the events happening in and around the classes. On the right side the student can find a to-do list and memo functionality which will encourage them to complete task on time. 

* The students can also check their due dates, upcoming events, class schedules in their calendar which would be an option inside the application.

* We are providing the chat option inside the application so that students can interact with the Professors as well as students.

* We are providing the additional options for students to change choice of themes according to their choice.
